MIC MBC measurement
=======

For **MIC** and **MBC** analysis determined with agar/broth dilution methods, people are very used to record their values in real numbers, which is not correct. For a test of (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32) µg/ml of a given drug, if the MIC reading is 8, instead of recording 8 µg/ml on the book, one should write down (4, 8]. This would give clear information not only on the break points that are chosen, but also implies the proper stats that can be applied: no test that assumes the data are continuous should be used; instead, use those on ordinal data type, such as Mann-Whitney U test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test, depends on whether the data are paired or not.
